### Howdy, folks! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Thanks for stopping by. I'm committed to software engineering and specialize in distributed web technologies. My expertise encompasses API and web app development, cloud infrastructure engineering, and solution architecture.

ðŸ’¬ Currently, I'm delving into AWS, JS/TS/Node.js, along with the Vue.js stack. I'm also extensively engaged in Microservices, Serverless cloud services, and IoT technologies. I'm constantly seeking better ideas to create products that can improve the lives of those around me.
