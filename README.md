### Howdy, folks! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Thank you for taking the time to visit. I'm a dedicated software engineer with a focus on distributed web technologies. My primary contributions lie in API and web app development, cloud infrastructure engineering, and solution architecture.

ðŸ’¬ At present, I'm particularly intrigued by Vue.js, and the JS/TS/Node.js stack. Additionally, I'm deeply involved in Serverless, cloud services, and IoT technologies. I'm always on the lookout for innovative ideas to create products that can enhance the lives of those around me.
